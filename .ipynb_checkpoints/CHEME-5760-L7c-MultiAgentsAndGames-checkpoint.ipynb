    "# Lab 7c: Simple Games - Traveler’s Dilemma\n",
    "The Traveler’s Dilemma is a non-cooperative __non-zero sum game__ that involves an airline losing two identical suitcases belonging to two different travelers. The airline requests that the travelers report the value of their suitcases, which must fall in the range of `2 USD` and `100 USD`, in increments of $\\pm$ `1 USD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Rules__:\n",
    "* If both travelers report the same value, they receive that value as a reward. \n",
    "* However, if the travelers report different values, the traveler with the lower value receives their reported value plus an additional `2 USD`, while the traveler with the higher value receives the lower value minus `2 USD`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reward function is determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "R_{i}(a_{i},a_{-i}) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "a_{i} & \\text{if } a_{i} = a_{-i} \\\\\n",
    "a_{i} + 2 & \\text{if } a_{i} < a_{-i} \\\\\n",
    "a_{-1} - 2 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people tend to put down between `97 USD` and `100 USD`. However, somewhat counter-intuitively, there is a unique [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) of only `2 USD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "The objective of `Lab 7c` is to familiarize students with the [Traveler’s Dilemma problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler%27s_dilemma), the solution of the problem using iterative refinement and the concept of [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The [Traveler’s Dilemma problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler%27s_dilemma) was first posed by [Kaushik Basu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaushik_Basu), a Cornell professor and former Chief Economist of the World Bank (2012 - 2016). For more information on this problem (beyond what is described here), check out this [article](https://www.academia.edu/56129718/The_Travelers_Dilemma). This problem (as we shall see) has a [Nash Equilibrium solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) of `2 USD`.\n",
    "* In [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no single player can gain by changing only their strategy."
