    "# Lab 6c: Optimal Stopping Problem: Computing the Price of American Options Contracts\n",
    "A binomial lattice model assumes that at each discrete time increment, the state of the system, e.g., the share price of equity, can either increase by a factor $u$ with probability $p$ or decrease by a factor $d$ with probability $(1-p)$ in the next time interval. Thus, each discrete time interval can be modeled as a [Bernoulli random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution):\n",

    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "The objective of `Lab 6c` is to familiarize students with computing future share price and the value of American `put` and `call` contracts using a [Binomial lattice approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model). \n",

    "    * `TODO`: Go to the board, draw the lattice, and walk through the decision process at each node. Ensure you understand this conceptually (the implementation details can come later)."

    "## Task 3: Inspect the Lattice nodes\n",
    "The nodes in the `hull_lattice_model`, which can be accessed using the `data` field, contain information about the `instrinsic` and `extrinsic` values of the `put` option contract. When dealing with American options contracts, it is important to understand these two types of values: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Intrinsic` value is the difference between the current market price of the underlying asset and the option’s strike price, indicating the immediate value that can be obtained by exercising the option at the current moment. \n",
    "* `Extrinsic` value, on the other hand, is the portion of the option’s premium that is not related to its intrinsic value. It represents the premium paid for the potential price movement of the underlying asset over the remaining time until the option’s expiration, as well as other factors such as implied volatility."
